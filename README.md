# Sales-Data-Analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib
In this project I have analyzed about 12 months worth of sales data containing hundreds of thousand of store purchase from an electronic store using two of the main libraries in python for Data Analysis Pandas and Matplotlib
Analyzed the best time to put advertisements.
Predicted which products can be put together to maximise the sales.
Plotted a few graphs to understand the company's sales flow better.
